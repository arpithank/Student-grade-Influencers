# Student-grade-Influencers

Many practical studies are carried out to investigate factors affecting college students’ performance. The focus of this project is to explore various factors that can influence student’s quality of learning and grades. Our primary measure of academic achievement is the student’s grade abstracted from the data set. I try to comprehend how these factors affect the students and their grades. I use several visualization techniques to explore these factors and determine the most influential factor among them all. In the process, I look into several techniques and plots that surprise us on the effects they have on the grades. My results reveal that Alcohol is the highest influencer of student grades. Increase in alcohol consumption results in small yet statistically significant reductions in grades for both male and female students. But this is not the only important factor I explore.
